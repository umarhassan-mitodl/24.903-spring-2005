There are two branches to this discipline: semantics, the study of conventional, \"compositional meaning\", and pragmatics, the study of interactional meaning. There are other contributaries: philosophy, logic, syntax, and psychology. We will try to give you an understanding of the concepts of semantics and pragmatics and of some of the technical tools that we use.\n",
